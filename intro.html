         <h2>Biography</h2> 
         <hr>
         Ebrahim Raisolsadati<b>(Persian: ابراهیم رئیس‌الساداتی; 14 December 1960 – 19 May 2024),</b> commonly known as Ebrahim Raisi (Persian: ابراهیم رئیسی [ebɾɒːˈhiːm-e ræʔiːˈsiː] ⓘ), was an Iranian politician who served as the eighth president of Iran from 2021 until his death in 2024.[8][9][10] A Principlist and a Muslim jurist, he became president after the 2021 election.
 
         Raisi began his clerical studies at age 15, but his exact qualification is disputed. Raisi served in several positions in Iran's judicial system, including as Prosecutor of Karaj, Prosecutor of Hamadan and Deputy Prosecutor and Prosecutor of Tehran. For his role on the Tehran "death committee" during the 1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners, Raisi was nicknamed the "Butcher of Tehran"; United Nations special rapporteurs and other organizations accused him of crimes against humanity. The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned him after Iran shot down an American drone in 2019.
         
         He was later Deputy Chief Justice (2004–2014), Attorney General (2014–2016), and Chief Justice (2019–2021). He was Custodian and Chairman of Astan Quds Razavi, a bonyad, from 2016 until 2019. He was a member of Assembly of Experts from South Khorasan Province, being elected for the first time in the 2006 election. He was the son-in-law of Mashhad Friday prayer leader and Grand Imam of Imam Reza shrine, Ahmad Alamolhoda.
         
         Raisi ran for president in 2017 as the candidate of the conservative Popular Front of Islamic Revolution Forces, losing to moderate incumbent president Hassan Rouhani, 57% to 38%. Raisi successfully ran for president a second time in 2021 with 63% of the votes, succeeding Rouhani. According to many observers, the 2021 Iranian presidential election was rigged in favour of Raisi, who was considered an ally of and a frontrunner to succeed Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei. Considered a hardliner in Iranian politics, Raisi's presidency saw deadlock in negotiations with the U.S. over the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and large-scale protests throughout the country in late 2022, triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini on 16 September. During Raisi's term, Iran intensified uranium enrichment, hindered international inspections, joined SCO and BRICS and supported Russia in its invasion of Ukraine. <b>Iran also launched a missile and drone attack on Israel during the Gaza conflict </b> continued arming proxy groups like Hezbollah and the Houthi movement.
